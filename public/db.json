It is the first month of the Hijri year and is one of the <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/97216\" rel=\"noopener\">sacred months</a> concerning which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year), so was it ordained by Allah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are Sacred, (i.e. the 1st, the 7th, the 11th and the 12th months of the Islamic calendar). That is the right religion, so wrong not yourselves therein.” [Soorat at-Tawbah 9:36].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “… The year is twelve months, of which four are sacred: three consecutive months, Dhu al-Qa‘dah, Dhu al-Hijjah and Muharram, and Rajab of Mudar which comes between Jumaada and Sha‘baan.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2958)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Why_Muharram_is_given_this_name\">Why Muharram is given this name</span></h3>\n<p>Muharram is so called because it is a sacred (muharram) month; this further emphasizes its sanctity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “so wrong not yourselves therein” [Soorat at-Tawbah 9:36] mean: (do not wrong yourselves) in these sacred months, because doing so is a greater sin than at other times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas said, concerning the words of Allah “so wrong not yourselves therein” [Soorat at-Tawbah 9:36]: (The command not to wrong yourself) applies in all months, then Allah singled out four months and made them sacred, and emphasised their sanctity, and He made sin during these months more grave, and He made righteous deeds and the reward thereof greater. Qataadah said, concerning the words “so wrong not yourselves therein”: Wrongdoing during the sacred months is more serious and incurs a greater burden of sin than in other months. Wrongdoing is a serious matter in any circumstances, but Allah makes whatever He wills of His commands carry more weight. And he said: Allah has chosen elites from His creation: from among the angels He chose Messengers, from among mankind He chose Messengers, from among speech He chose remembrance of Him (dhikr), from among spaces on earth He chose the mosques, from among the months He chose Ramadan and the sacred months, from among days He chose Friday (Jumu‘ah), and from among nights He chose Laylat al-Qadr. So venerate that which has been chosen by Allah, for people of understanding and wisdom respect that which has been chosen by Allah.” (Tafseer Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him), commentary on Soorat at-Tawbah verse 36)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Virtue_of_fasting_in_Muharram\">Virtue of fasting in Muharram</span></h3>\n<p>Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “<a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21311\" rel=\"noopener\">The best fast after Ramadan is in the month of Allah Muharram</a>.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1982)</p>\n<p>The phrase “the month of Allah (shahr Allah)” is indicative of the veneration this month deserves, as it is attributed to Allah (in a genitive or idaafah phrase). Al-Qaari said: What appears to be the case is that what is meant is the entire month of Muharram.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never fasted any month in full apart from Ramadan. So this hadeeth is to be understood as meaning that it is encouraged to <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/128423\" rel=\"noopener\">fast a great deal during the month of Muharram</a>, not to fast the entire month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fasted a great deal during Sha‘baan, and perhaps the virtue of Muharram was not revealed to him until the end of his life, before he was able to fast during this month. (Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Saheeh Muslim)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Allah_chooses_whatever_He_wills_of_times_and_places\">Allah chooses whatever He wills of times and places</span></h3>\n<p>Al-‘Izz ibn ‘Abd as-Salaam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Superiority of times and places is of two types, the first of which is in worldly terms and the second is in religious or spiritual terms because of what Allah bestows upon His slaves at those times and in those places of a greater reward for deeds, such as the greater virtue of fasting Ramadan over fasting in other months or on the day of ‘Ashoora’. Its virtue is due to Allah’s generosity and kindness to His slaves during it.” (Qawaa‘id al-Ahkaam, 1/38)&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "body": "<h3><span id=\"Ashura_in_History\">`Ashura in History</span></h3>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madeenah and saw the Jews fasting on the <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4033\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">day of `Ashura</a>. He said, ‘What is this?’ They said, ‘This is a righteous day, it is the day when Allah saved the Children of Israel from their enemies, so Moosa fasted on this day.’ He said, ‘We have more right to Moosa than you,’ so he fasted on that day and commanded [the Muslims] to fast on that day.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1865)</p>\n<p>“This is a righteous day” – in a report narrated by Muslim, [the Jews said:] “This is a great day, on which Allah saved Moosa and his people, and drowned Pharaoh and his people.”</p>\n<p>“Moosa fasted on this day” – a report narrated by Muslim adds: “… in thanksgiving to Allah, so we fast on this day.”</p>\n<p>According to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari: “… so we fast on this day to venerate it.”</p>\n<p>A version narrated by Imaam Ahmad adds: “This is the day on which the Ark settled on Mount Joodi, so Nooh fasted this day in thanksgiving.”</p>\n<p>“and commanded [the Muslims] to fast on that day” – according to another report also narrated by al-Bukhaari: “He said to his Companions: ‘You have more right to Moosa than they do, so fast on that day.”</p>\n<p>The practice of fasting on `Ashura was known even in the days of Jaahiliyyah, before the Prophet’s mission. It was reported that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The people of Jaahiliyyah used to fast on that day…”</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi said: “Perhaps Quraysh used to fast on that day on the basis of some past law, such as that of Ibraaheem, upon whom be peace.”</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on `Ashura in Makkah, before he migrated to Madeenah. When he migrated to Madeenah, he found the Jews celebrating this day, so he asked them why, and they replied as described in the hadeeth quoted above. He commanded the Muslims to be different from the Jews, who took it as a festival, as was reported in the hadeeth of Abu Moosa (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Jews used to take the day of `Ashura as a festival [according to a report narrated by Muslim: the day of `Ashura was venerated by the Jews, who took it as a festival. According to another report also narrated by Muslim: the people of Khaybar (the Jews) used to take it as a festival and their women would wear their jewellery and symbols on that day]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘So you [Muslims] should fast on that day.’” (Reported by al-Bukhaari). Apparently the motive for commanding the Muslims to fast on this day was the desire to be different from the Jews, so that the Muslims would fast when the Jews did not, because people do not fast on a day of celebration. (Summarized from the words of al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar – may Allah have mercy on him – in <em>Fath al-Baari Sharh ‘ala Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>).</p>\n<p>Fasting on `Ashura was a gradual step in the process of introducing fasting as a prescribed obligation in Islam. Fasting appeared in three forms. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madeenah, he told the Muslims to fast on three days of every month and on the day of `Ashura, then Allah made fasting obligatory when He said (interpretation of the meaning): <em>“… observing the fasting is prescribed for you…” [Al-Baqarah 2:183]</em> (<em>Ahkaam al-Qur’aan</em> by al-Jassas, part 1).</p>\n",

Among the months, Allah has chosen four which He has made sacred, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year), so it was ordained by Allah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are Sacred. That is the right religion, so wrong not yourselves therein…” [al-Tawbah 9:36]</p>\n<p>These months are calculated according to the movements of the moon, not the movements of the sun, as the disbeleivers do.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_are_the_Sacred_months\">What are the Sacred months?</span></h2>\n<p>The Sacred Months are mentioned by implication in the Quran, but their names are not given. Their names are mentioned in the Sunnah:</p>\n<p>Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave his Farewell Sermon and said: “Time has completed its cycle and is as it was on the Day when Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year is twelve months, of which four are sacred, three consecutive months – Dhu’l-Qa’dah, Dhu’l-Hijjah and Muharram – and the Rajab of Mudar which comes between Jumaada and Sha’baan.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, no. 1741, in [Kitaab] al-Hajj, al-Khutbah Ayaam Mina; and by Muslim, no. 1679, in [Kitaab] al-Qisaamah, Baab Tahreem al-Dimaa’)</p>\n<p>It was called Rajab of Mudar because [the tribe of] Mudar did not tamper with its timing, unlike the rest of the Arabs, who used to tamper with the months and change their order depending on whether they were in a state of war or not. This was the postponing referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“The postponing (of a Sacred Month) is indeed an addition to disbelief: thereby the disbelievers are led astray, for they make it lawful one year and forbid it another year in order to adjust the number of months&nbsp;forbidden by Allah, and make such forbidden ones lawful.” [al-Tawbah 9:37]</p>\n<p>It was also said that the reason why it was attributed to Mudar was because they venerated it and respected it so much, so it was attributed to them.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_reason_why_Rajab_is_given_this_name\">The reason why Rajab is given this name</span></h2>\n<p>Ibn Faaris said in&nbsp;Mu’jam Maqaayees al-Lughah&nbsp;(p. 445):</p>\n<p>The letters&nbsp;Ra’, jeem&nbsp;and&nbsp;ba’&nbsp;form a root which indicates supporting and strengthening something with another thing. … Hence the phrase “Rajabtu’l-shay’” means I venerated it… It was called Rajab because they used to venerate it, and it is also venerated in Sharee’ah.</p>\n<p>The people of the Jaahiliyyah used to call Rajab&nbsp;Munassil al-Asinnah&nbsp;[the one that causes the sharp heads of weapons to be taken off], as it was reported that Abu Rajaa’ al-‘Ataaridi said:</p>\n<p>We would a rock, then if we found a better rock we would throw the first one aside and adopt the other. If we could not find a rock, we would make a pile of dirt, then we would bring a ewe and milk it over the pile of dirt, then we would do tawaaf around it. When the month of Rajab came, we would say&nbsp;Munassil al-Asinnah&nbsp;[the one that causes the sharp heads of weapons to be taken off], and we would not leave any spear or arrow that had an iron piece in it but we would take the metal head off and put it aside during the month of Rajab. (Narrated by al-Bukhari).</p>\n<p>Al-Bayhaqi said: the people of the jaahiliyyah used to venerate these sacred months, especially the month of Rajab, and they would not fight during this month.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_month_of_Rajab_is_a_sacred_month\">The month of Rajab is a sacred month</span></h2>\n<p>The Sacred months have a special status, which applies also to <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/317278\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rajab because it is one of these sacred months</a>. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the Symbols of Allah, nor of the Sacred Month…” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]</p>\n<p>This means: do not violate their sanctity which Allah has commanded you to respect and forbidden you to violate, for this prohibition includes both vile deeds and vile beliefs.</p>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“so wrong not yourselves therein…” [al-Tawbah 9:36]&nbsp;meaning, in the Sacred Months. The pronoun here [translated here as “therein”] refers to these four sacred months, as stated by the Imam of the Mufassireen, Ibn Jareer al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him).</p>\n<p>So we should pay attention to the sanctity of these four months, because Allah has singled them out for a special status and has forbidden us to commit sins out of respect for their sanctity, for sins committed at this time are even worse, because of the sanctity of the time which Allah has made sacred. Hence in the aayah quoted above, Allah has forbidden us to wrong ourselves even though this – i.e., wronging ourselves, which includes committing sins – is forbidden during all the months of the year.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Fighting_during_the_sacred_months\">Fighting during the sacred months</span></h2>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“They ask you concerning fighting in the sacred months. Say: fighting therein is a great (transgression)…” [al-Baqarah 2:217]</p>\n<p>The majority of scholars state that (the prohibition of) fighting in the sacred months is abrogated by the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Then when the sacred months have passed, then kill the Mushrikeen wherever you find them…” [al-Tawbah 9:5], and other aayat and reports which are general in application and which include commands to fight them.</p>\n<p>Others say: it is not permissible to initiate fighting during the sacred months, but it is permissible to continue and conclude fighting, if it started at a different time. The fighting of the Prophet&nbsp;(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) against the people of al-Taa’if is interpreted in this way, because the fighting had begun at Hunayn in Shawwaal.</p>\n<p>The above does not apply to fighting in self-defence. If the enemy attacks the Muslim lands, it is obligatory for the inhabitants to defend themselves, whether that happens during a sacred month or not.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Offering_Ateerah_in_the_month_of_Rajab\">Offering Ateerah in the month of Rajab</span></h2>\n<p>During the Jaahiliyyah, the Arabs used to slaughter a sacrifice during Rajab as an act of worship towards their idols.</p>\n<p>When Islam came, teaching that sacrifices were to be offered only to Allah, this deed of the Jaahiliyyah was abolished. The fuqaha’ differed as to the rulings on offering sacrifices during Rajab. The majority of Hanafis, Maalikis and Hanbalis stated that the <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sacrifice of al-‘Ateerah</a> was abrogated. Their evidence was the hadith, “There is no&nbsp;Fir’&nbsp;and no&nbsp;‘Ateerah”, narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah.</p>\n<p>The Shaafa’is said that&nbsp;al-‘Ateerah&nbsp;had not been abrogated, and they regarded it as&nbsp;mustahabb&nbsp;(recommended). This was also the view of Ibn Seereen.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hajar said: this is supported by the hadith narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Nisaa’i, and Ibn Maajah, and classed as saheeh by al-Haakim and Ibn al-Mundhir, from Nubayshah, who said:</p>\n<p>A man called out to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): We used to offer the sacrifice of al-‘Ateerah during the Jaahiliyyah in the month of Rajab. What do you command us to do? He said, Offer sacrifices, no matter which month is it…</p>\n<p>Ibn Hajar said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not abolish it in principle, but he abolished the idea of making this sacrifice especially in Rajab.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Fasting_in_Rajab\">Fasting in Rajab</span></h2>\n<p>There is no saheeh report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from the Sahaabah to indicate that there is any particular virtue in <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/75394\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fasting during Rajab</a>.</p>\n<p>The fasting that is prescribed in Rajab is the same as that prescribed in other months, namely fasting on Mondays and Thursdays, and the three days of al-Beed, fasting alternate days, and fasting&nbsp;Sirar al-Shahr. Some of the scholars said that&nbsp;Sirar al-Shahr&nbsp;refers to the beginning of the month; others said that it refers to the middle or end of the month. ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to forbid fasting in Rajab because it involved resemblance to the Jaahiliyyah. It was reported that Kharashah ibn al-Harr said: I saw ‘Umar smacking the hands of those who fasted in Rajab until they reached out for food, and he was saying, This is a month which was venerated in the Jaahiliyyah. (al-Irwaa’, 957; al-Albaani said: it is saheeh).</p>\n<p>Imam Ibn al-Qayyim said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not fast for three consecutive months (i.e., Rajab, Sha’baan and Ramadan) as some people do, and he never fasted Rajab at all, nor did he encourage people to fast this month.</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in&nbsp;Tabayyun al-‘Ajab bimaa wurida fi Fadl Rajab:</p>\n<p>No saheeh hadith that may be used as evidence has been narrated concerning the virtues of the month of Rajab or fasting this month or fasting in any specific part of it, or observing Qiyaam al-Layl specifically during this month. Imam Abu Ismaa’eel al-Harawi al-Haafiz has already stated this before me, and we have narrated this from others also.</p>\n<p>In Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah it states: with regard to fasting specifically in Rajab, we do not know of any basis in Sharee’ah for doing that.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Umrah_in_Rajab\">Umrah in Rajab</span></h2>\n<p>The ahaadeeth indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do<a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36766\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> ‘Umrah during Rajab</a>, as it was narrated that Mujaahid said: ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr and I entered the mosque, and there was ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar sitting near the room of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). He was asked, “How many times did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)&nbsp; do ‘Umrah?” He said, “Four times, and one of them was in Rajab.” We did not want to argue with him. We could hear ‘Aa’ishah Umm al-Mu’mineen brushing her teeth (i.e., the sound of the miswaak) in her room. ‘Urwah said, “O Mother of the Believers, did you not hear what Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan is saying?” She said, “What is he saying?” He said, “He is saying that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ‘Umrah four times, one of them in Rajab.” She said, “May Allah have mercy on Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] never did ‘Umrah but he witnesses it (i.e., he was present with him), and he never did ‘Umrah during Rajab.” (Agreed upon).</p>\n<p>It was reported by Muslim that Ibn ‘Umar heard this and did not say yes or no. Al-Nawawi said: the fact that Ibn ‘Umar remained silent when ‘Aa’ishah denied what he said indicates that he was confused, or had forgotten, or was uncertain. Hence it is an innovated bid’ah to single out Rajab for making ‘Umrah and to believe that doing ‘Umrah in Rajab has a specific virtue. Nothing to that effect has been narrated, besides the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not reported to have made ‘Umrah during Rajab at all.</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Ali ibn Ibraaheem al-‘Attaar (d. 724 AH) said:</p>\n<p>One of the things that I have heard about the people of Makkah – may Allah increase it in honour – is that they do ‘Umrah frequently during Rajab. This is something for which I know of no basis, all I know is that it was reported in the hadith that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “ ‘Umrah in Ramadan is equivalent to Hajj.”</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his&nbsp;Fatawaa:</p>\n<p>As for singling out some of the days of Rajab for any kind of good deed, ziyaarah (visiting the House of Allah, the Ka’bah) or anything else, there is no basis for this, because Imam Abu Shaamah stated in his book&nbsp;al-Bida’ wa’l-Hawaadith: specifying acts of worship at times that were not specified by sharee’ah is wrong; no time is to be regarded as better than any other except in cases where the sharee’ah gave preference to a certain act of worship at a certain time, or stated that any good deed done at this time is better than good deeds done at other times. Hence the scholars denounced the practice of singling out the month of Rajab for doing ‘Umrah frequently.</p>\n<p>But if a person goes for ‘Umrah during Rajab without believing that this has any particular virtue and because it is just a coincidence that it is easier for him to go at this time, then there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bidrsquoah_in_the_month_of_Rajab\">Bid’ah in the month of Rajab</span></h2>\n<p>Innovation in religion is one of the serious matters which go against the Book of Allah and the Sunnah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not die until after the religion had been perfected. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“… This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion…” [al-Maa’idah 5:3]</p>\n<p>It was reported that ‘Aa’isha (may Allah be pleased with her) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours which is not a part of it, will have it rejected.” (Agreed upon).</p>\n<p>According to a report narrated by Muslim: “Whoever does an action which is not a part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.”</p>\n<p>Some people have innovated a number of practices in Rajab, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60180\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Salaat al-Raghaa’ib</a>. This prayer became widespread after the first and best centuries, especially in the fourth century AH. Some liars fabricated this prayer, which is done on the first night of Rajab. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Salaat al-Raghaa’ib is bid’ah according to the consensus of the scholars of religion, such as Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, Abu Haneefah, al-Thawri, al-‘Oozaa’i, al-Layth and others . The hadith that is narrated concerning it is a lie according to the consensus of the scholars who have knowledge of hadith.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It was reported that major events happened in the month of Rajab, but none of these reports are true. It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was born on the first night of Rajab, and that he received his Mission on the twenty-seventh, or twenty-fifth of this month. None of this is correct. It was reported with an isnaad that is not saheeh from al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad that the Prophet’s Night Journey (al-Israa’) took place on the twenty-seventh of Rajab. This was denied by Ibraaheem al-Harbi and others. One of the innovations that take place during this month is the recitation of the story of the Mi’raaj, and celebrations to commemorate it on the twenty-seventh of Rajab, or singling out this night to perform extra acts of worship such as Qiyaam al-Layl or fasting during the day, or rejoicing and celebrating. Some celebrations are accompanied by haraam things such as mixing of men and women, singing and music, all of which are not permitted on the two Eids which are prescribed in Islam, let alone innovated celebrations. Add to that the fact that there is no proof that the Israa’ and Mi’raaj happened on this date. Even if it were proven, that is no excuse for holding celebrations on this date, because nothing of the kind has been reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from his companions, may Allah be pleased with them, or from any of the Salaf (early generations) of this Ummah. If it were a good thing, they would surely have done it before us. May Allah help us.</li>\n<li>Salaat Umm Dawood halfway through Rajab.</li>\n<li>The du’aa’s which are recited specifically during Rajab are all fabrications and innovations.</li>\n<li>Visiting graves specifically in Rajab is bid’ah, because graves are to be visited at any time of the year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We ask Allah to make us of those who venerate the things that He has made sacred and adhere to the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) outwardly and inwardly, for He is the One Whom we should ask and He is Able to do that. And the close of our request is: praise be to Allah, the Lord of&nbsp; ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists).</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Muslim parents have an unavoidable duty towards their children, to raise them well and bring them up properly, to urge them to do all kinds of goodness and make them get used to that. Here are 19 tips for parents in Ramadan to make the most of it.</p>\n",
      "body": "<p>It is one of the blessings of Allah to the Muslim that He enables him to fast in <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13480\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ramadan</a> and to spend its nights in prayer. It is a month in which good deeds are multiplied and people are raised in status, when Allah frees some people from the Fire. So the Muslim should strive to make the most of this month and the goodness it brings; he should hasten to spend his life in worship. How many people have been deprived of this month because of sickness, death or misguidance.</p>\n<p>The Muslim must make the most of his time during this month; he has an unavoidable duty towards his children, to raise them well and bring them up properly, to urge them to do all kinds of goodness and make them get used to that – because the child will grow up in the manner to which his father makes him get accustomed.</p>\n<h2>Tips for parents in Ramadan</h2>\n<p>During these blessed days, the father and mother have a role to play in making the most of this time, and we can offer parents the following advice:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/139252\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Checking on the children’s fasting</a> and encouraging those who fall short in this regard.</li>\n<li>Reminding them about the real nature of fasting, and that it is not just giving up food and drink, but it is a means of attaining taqwa (piety), and that it is an opportunity for sins to be forgiven and expiated.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ascended the minbar and said: “Ameen, Ameen, Ameen.” It was said to him, “O Messenger of Allah, why did you do that?” He said, “Jibreel said to me, ‘May Allah rub his nose in the dust, that person who Ramadan comes and his sins are not forgiven,’ and I said, ‘Ameen’. Then he said, ‘May Allah rub his nose in the dust, that person who lives to see his parents grow old, one or both of them, but he does not enter Paradise,’ and I said, ‘Ameen’. Then he said, ‘May Allah rub his nose in the dust, that person in whose presence you are mentioned and he does not send blessings upon you,’ and I said, ‘Ameen.’” (Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah, 1888; al-Tirmidhi, 3545; Ahmad, 7444; Ibn Hibbaan, 908. See&nbsp;<em>Saheeh al-Jaami’</em>, 3501)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Teaching them the <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13348\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">etiquette and rulings on eating</a>, such as eating with the right hand from what is directly in front of them; reminding them that extravagance is haram and is harmful to the body.</li>\n<li>Not letting them spend too long on <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65711\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eating iftar</a> so that they miss praying Maghrib in congregation.</li>\n<li>Reminding them about the situation of the poor and destitute who cannot find even a mouthful of food to quench the fires of hunger; reminding them of the situation of those who have migrated or are fighting in jihad for the sake of Allah in all places.</li>\n<li>These gatherings offer an opportunity to bring relatives together and uphold the ties of kinship. This custom still exists in some countries, and it is an opportunity to reconcile and mend broken ties between relatives.</li>\n<li>Helping the mother to prepare the food, and to clean up and keep the food fit for eating.</li>\n<li>Reminding them to pray qiyam (<a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tarawih</a>) and to prepare for it by not eating too much and to get ready in time to perform the prayer in the mosque.</li>\n<li>With regard to <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65955\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suhoor</a>, the parents should remind the family of the barakah (blessing) of suhoor and that it gives a person the strength to fast.</li>\n<li>Allowing enough time before Fajr prayer so that those who have not prayed Witr may do so, and so that those who have delayed their prayer until the end of the night may pray, and so that each person may make du`a to his Lord as he wishes.</li>\n<li>Paying attention to praying Fajr on time in congregation in the mosque, for those who are required to do so. We have seen many people who wake up at the end of the night to eat, then they go back to bed and neglect Fajr prayer.</li>\n<li>It was the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37720\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last ten days of Ramadan</a> to stay up at night and wake his family. This indicates that the family should pay attention to making the most of this blessed time in doing things that are pleasing to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. So the husband should wake his wife and children to do that which will bring them closer to their Lord.</li>\n<li>There may be small children in the house who need to be encouraged to fast, so the father should urge them to get up for suhoor, and encourage them to fast by praising them and giving a reward to the one who fasts the whole month or half of it, and so on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Al-Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwidh said:&nbsp; On the morning of Ashura the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent word to the villages of the Ansaar saying, “Whoever started out not fasting, let him not eat for the rest of the day, and whoever started the day fasting, let him fast.” She said: We used to fast and make our children fast, [and take them to the mosques] and make toys for them out of wool, then if one of them cried for food we would give him that toy until iftar. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1859; Muslim, 1136 – the words in square brackets were narrated by Muslim)</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said:</p>\n<p>“This hadith shows that we should train children to do acts of worship and get them used to that, but they are not accountable. Al-Qaadi said: It was narrated from ‘Urwah that when they are able to fast it becomes obligatory upon them. This is a mistake which is disproven by the saheeh hadeeth, “The Pen is lifted from three: from the child until he reaches adolescence…” And Allah knows best.” <em>(Sharh Muslim</em>, 8/14)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If possible, the father and mother should take the family for <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/104926\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">`Umrah in Ramadan</a>, and that is something that will benefit them in the Hereafter,, themselves and their family, for `Umrah during Ramadan has the same reward as Hajj. It is better to go at the beginning of Ramadan so as to avoid the crowds.</li>\n<li>The husband should not overburden his wife with more than she can bear of having to prepare food and sweets. Many people take this month to prepare fancy foods and drinks, and they go extremes in that. This detracts from the sweetness of this month and goes against the reason for fasting, which is to attain piety.</li>\n<li>The month of Ramadan is the month of the Quran, so we suggest that each family gets together to read Quran. The father should teach his family to recite Quran and help them to understand the meanings of the verses. In the same gathering they may also read a book about the rulings and etiquette of fasting. Allah has enabled many scholars and seekers of knowledge to write books which can be used for preaching and teaching during Ramadan; the books are divided into thirty parts, so one topic can be read each day, and this will benefit everyone.</li>\n<li>They should be encouraged to spend and check on their neighbours and the needy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ibn `Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous during Ramadan when Jibreel met him. He would meet him each night and revise the Qur’aan with him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was more generous than the blowing wind. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6; Muslim, 2308)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The parents should prevent their families and children from staying up late at night and wasting their time in things that are of no benefit, let alone things that are haram. For the devils among mankind are more active in this month in promoting evil things and acts of immorality to those who are fasting, during the nights of Ramadan and during the days.</li>\n<li>They should remember the family’s meeting in Allah’s Paradise in the Hereafter, and the great joy of meeting there under the shade of His throne. These blessed gatherings in this world and coming together to obey Allah by seeking knowledge, fasting and praying are only the means that lead to attaining that happiness.</li>\n</ol>\n",

And blessings and peace be upon His Prophet and Messenger Muhammad, the Prophet of repentance and mercy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):</p>\n<p>“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion [al-Maa’idah 5:3]</p>\n<p>“Or have they partners with Allaah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not ordained? [al-Shooraa 42:21]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In al-Saheehayn it is reported from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours [Islam] that is not part of it, will have it rejected.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Saheeh Muslim it is narrated from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say in his Friday khutbahs: “The best of speech is the Book of Allaah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The most evil of things are those which are newly-invented, and every innovation (bid’ah) is a going-astray.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And there are many aayaat and ahaadeeth which say similar things.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This clearly indicates that Allaah has perfected the religion of this ummah, and completed His favour upon them. He did not take the soul of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) until he had conveyed the Message clearly and explained to the ummah everything that Allaah had prescribed for it of words and deeds. He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that everything that people would innovate after he was gone, all the words and deeds that they would attribute to Islam, all of that would be thrown back on the one who invented it, even if his intention was good. The companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) knew this matter, as did the scholars of Islam after them. They denounced bid’ah and warned against it, as has been stated by all those who wrote books praising the Sunnah and denouncing bid’ah, such as Ibn Waddaah, al-Tartooshi, Ibn Shaamah and others.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_celebrating_the_middle_of_Shaban_allowed\">Is celebrating the middle of Shaban allowed?</span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;Among the bid’ahs that have been invented by some people is <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/154183\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">celebrating the middle of Shaban</a> (Laylat al-Nusf min Shaban), and singling out that day for fasting. There is no evidence (daleel) for that which can be regarded as reliable. Some da’eef (weak) ahaadeeth have been narrated concerning its virtues, but we cannot regard them as reliable. The reports which have been narrated concerning the virtues of prayer on this occasion are all mawdoo’ (fabricated),&nbsp; as has been pointed out by many of the scholars. We will quote some of their comments below, in sha&nbsp; Allaah.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Some reports have also been narrated on this matter from some of the salaf in Syria, and others. What the majority of scholars say is that celebrating this occasion is bid’ah, and that the ahaadeeth concerning the virtues of this occasion are all da’eef (weak), and some of them are mawdoo’ (fabricated) Among those who pointed this out was al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab, in his book Lataa’if al-Ma’aarif, and others. The da’eef ahaadeeth concerning acts of worship can only be acted upon in the case of acts of worship which are proven by saheeh evidence. There is no saheeh basis for <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49678\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">celebrating the middle of Shaban</a>, so we cannot follow the da’eef ahaadeeth either.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;This important principle was mentioned by Imaam Abu’l-‘Abbaas Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) were agreed that it is obligatory to refer matters concerning which the people dispute to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whatever ruling both or one of them give is the sharee’ah which must be followed, and whatever goes against them must be rejected. Any acts of worship which are not mentioned in them are therefore bid’ah and it is not permissible to do them, let alone call others to do them or approve of them. As Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination [al-Nisaa’ 4:59]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;“And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allaah (He is the ruling Judge).”&nbsp;[al-Shooraa 42:10]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Say (O Muhammad to mankind): “If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’aan and the Sunnah), Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins.\" [Aal ‘Imraan 3:31]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.”&nbsp;[al-Nisaa’ 4:65]</p>\n<p>And there are many similar aayaat which clearly state that matters of dispute are to be referred to the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and that their ruling is to be accepted. This is the requirement of faith and this is what is best for people in this world and in the next: “That is better and more suitable for final determination.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:59 – interpretation of the meaning] means, in the Hereafter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book Lataa’if al-Ma’aarif concerning this matter – after previously discussing it –:</p>\n<p>“<a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/249623\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Laylat al-Nusf min Shaban</a> (the middle of Shaban) was venerated by the Taabi’een among the people of al-Shaam, such as Khaalid ibn Mi’daan, Makhool, Luqmaan ibn ‘Aamir and others, who used to strive in worship on this night. The people took the idea of the virtue of this night and of venerating it from them. It was said that they heard of Israa’eeli reports (reports from Jewish sources) concerning that. Most of the scholars of the Hijaaz denounced that, including ‘Ataa’ and Ibn Abi Maleekah. ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam narrated that view from the fuqahaa’ of Madeenah, and this was the view of the companions of Maalik and others. They said: this is all bid’ah… No comment from Imaam Ahmad concerning Laylat al-Nusf min Shaban is known of…&nbsp; Concerning spending the night of the middle of Shaban in prayer, there is no sound report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from his companions…”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is what was said by al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab (may Allaah be pleased with him). He clearly states that there is no sound report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) about Laylat al-Nusf min Shaban (the middle of Shaban).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In every case where there is no sound shar’i evidence that a thing is prescribed in Islam, it is not permissible for the Muslim to innovate things in the religion of Allaah, whether these are individual acts or communal acts, whether he does them in secret or openly, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever does any action that is not a part of this matter of ours [Islam], will have it rejected.” And there are other daleels (evidence) which indicate that bid’ah is to be denounced and which warn against it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imaam Abu Bakr al-Tartooshi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in his book al-Hawaadith wa’l-Bida’: “Ibn Waddaah narrated that Zayd ibn Aslam said: We never met anyone among our shaykhs and fuqahaa’ who paid any attention to Laylat al-Nusf min Shaban, or who paid any attention to the hadeeth of Makhool, or who thought that this night was any more special than other nights. It was said to Ibn Abi Maleekah that Ziyaad al-Numayri was saying that the reward of Laylat al-Nusf min Shaban was like the reward of Laylat al-Qadr. He said, If I heard him say that and I had a stick in my hand, I would hit him. Ziyaad was a story-teller.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-‘Allaamah al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fawaa’id al-Majmoo’ah:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The hadeeth: ‘O ‘Ali, whoever prays one hundred rak’ahs on Laylat al-Nusf min Shaban, reciting in each rak’ah the Opening of the Book [Soorat al-Faatihah] and Qul Huwa Allaahu Ahad ten times, Allaah will meet all his needs…’ This is mawdoo’ (fabricated) [i.e., it is falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him]. Its wording clearly states the reward that the person who does this will attain, and no man who has any common sense can doubt that this is fabricated. Also, the men of its isnaad are majhool (unknown). It was also narrated via another isnaad, all of which is mawdoo’ (fabricated) and all of whose narrators are majhool (unknown).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In al-Mukhtasar he said: The hadeeth about the salaah for the middle of Shaban is false, and the hadeeth of ‘Ali narrated by Ibn Hibbaan – “ When it is the night of the middle of Shaban, spend that night in prayer and fast that day” – is da’eef (weak).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In al-La’aali’ he said, “One hundred rak’ahs in the middle of Shaban, reciting (Soorat) al-Ikhaas ten times in each… (this is) mawdoo’ (fabricated), and all its narrators in its three isnaads are majhool (unknown) and da’eef (weak). He said: and twelve rak’ahs, reciting al-Ikhlaas thirty times in each, this is mawdoo’; and fourteen (rak’ahs), this is mawdoo’.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A group of fuqahaa’ were deceived by this hadeeth, such as the author of al-Ihyaa’ and others, as were some of the mufassireen. The prayer of this night – the middle of Shaban – was described in different ways, all of which are false and fabricated.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz al-‘Iraaqi said: “The hadeeth about the prayer during the night of the middle of Shaban is fabricated and is falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imaam al-Nawawi said in his book al-Majmoo’: “The prayer that is known as salaat al-raghaa’ib, which is twelve rak’ahs between Maghrib and ‘Ishaa’ on the night of the first Friday in Rajab, and the prayer of Laylat al-Nusf min Shaban, of one hundred rak’ahs – these two prayers are reprehensible bid’ahs. No one should be deceived by the fact that they are mentioned in the books Qoot al-Quloob and Ihyaa’ ‘Uloom al-Deen, or by the hadeeth which is mentioned in these two books. All of that is false. Nor should they be deceived by the fact that some of the imaams were confused about this matter and wrote a few pages stating that these prayers are mustahabb, for they were mistaken in that.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Imaam Abu Muhammad ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Ismaa’eel al-Maqdisi wrote a very valuable book proving that these (reports) are false, and he did a very good job. The scholars spoke at length about this matter, and if we were to quote all that we have read of what they have said about this matter, it would take far too long. Perhaps what we have already mentioned is sufficient to convince the seeker of truth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From the aayahs, ahaadeeth and scholarly opinions quoted above, it is clear to the seeker of truth that celebrating the middle of Shaban by praying on that night or in any other way, or by singling out that day for fasting, is a bid’ah which is denounced by most of the scholars. It has no basis in the pure sharee’ah; rather it is one of the things that was innovated in Islam after the time of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). It is sufficient for the seeker of truth, in this case and in others, to know the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This day, I have perfected your religion for you…” [al-Maa’idah 5:3]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>and other similar aayaat; and the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours [Islam] that is not part of it, will have it rejected.”&nbsp;and other similar ahaadeeth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Saheeh Muslim it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Do not single out the night of Jumu’ah for praying qiyaam and do not single out the day of Jumu’ah for fasting, unless is it part of the ongoing regular fast of any one of you.’”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it were permissible to single out any night for special acts of worship, the night of Jumu’ah would be the most appropriate, because the day of Jumu’ah (Friday) is the best day upon which the sun rises, as is stated in the saheeh hadeeth narrated from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Since the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against singling out that night for praying qiyaam, that indicates that it is even more prohibited to single out any other night for acts of worship, except where there is saheeh evidence to indicate that a particular night is to be singled out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because it is prescribed to spend the nights of Laylat al-Qadr and the other nights of Ramadaan in prayer, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) drew attention to that and urged his ummah to pray qiyaam during those nights. He also did that himself, as is indicated in al-Saheehayn, where it says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays qiyaam in Ramadaan out of faith and seeking reward, Allaah will forgive him his previous sins” and “Whoever spends the night of Laylat al-Qadr in prayer&nbsp; out of faith and seeking reward, Allaah will forgive him his previous sins.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if it were prescribed to<a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8907\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> single out the night of the middle of Shaban</a>, or the night of the first Friday in Rajab, or the night of the Israa’ and Mi’raaj, for celebration or for any special acts of worship, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have taught his ummah to do that, and he would have done it himself. If anything of the sort had happened, his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) would have transmitted it to the ummah; they would not have concealed it from them, for they are the best of people and the most sincere, after the Prophets, may blessings and peace be upon them, and may Allaah be pleased with all the companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now we know from the words of the scholars quoted above that there is no report from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) concerning the virtue of the first night of Jumu’ah in Rajab, or the night of the middle of Shaban. So we know that celebrating these occasions is an innovation that has been introduced into Islam, and that singling out these occasions for acts of worship is a reprehensible bid’ah. The same applies to the twenty-seventh night of Rajab, which some people believe is the night of the Israa’ and Mi’raaj; it is not permissible to single this date out for acts of worship, or to celebrate this occasion, on the basis of the evidence (daleel) quoted above. This is the case if the exact date (of the Israa’ and Mi’raaj) is known, so how about the fact that the correct scholarly view is that its date is not known! The view that it is the night of the twenty-seventh of Rajab is a false view which has no basis in the saheeh ahaadeeth. He indeed spoke well who said: “The best of matters are those which follow the guided way of the salaf, and the most evil of matters are those which are newly-innovated.”</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to help us and all the Muslims adhere firmly to the Sunnah and to beware of everything that goes against it, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.</p>\n<p>May Allaah bless His slave and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, and all his family and companions.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Reference\">Reference</span></h3>\n<p>Adapted from Majmoo’ Fataawa Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, 2/882</p>\n",

In it the gates of heaven are opened and the gates of Hell are closed, and the strong devils are chained up. In it there is a night that is better than a thousand months, and whoever is deprived of its goodness is indeed deprived.”&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Narrated by Ahmad, 9213; al-Nasaa’i, 2106. classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Nasaa’i</i>, 1992.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">This hadeeth brings glad tidings to the righteous slaves of Allaah of the onset of the month of Ramadaan, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) that it had come, but he was not merely informing them, rather he was giving them glad tidings of a great occasion which is properly appreciated by the righteous who preare themselves for it, because he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained what Allaah has prepared in this month of the means of attaining forgiveness and the pleasure of Allaah. There are many such means, and whoever misses out on forgiveness in Ramadaan is indeed deprived. It is by the grace and blessing of Allaah to His slaves that He has prepared for them this great occasion in which they can compete in doing acts of worship and earning great reward. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The one who is truly blessed is the one who makes the most of months, days and hours, and draws close to his Lord by doing the acts of worship prescribed at those times. (<i>Ahaadeeth al-Siyaam</i> by al-Fawzaan, p. 13)&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">Ramadaan has come, in which the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are closed. The reason – and Allaah knows best – is that there is a great deal of goodness in Ramadaan and people turn more to the means of attaining forgiveness and Allaah’s pleasure. So there is less evil on earth, as the strong devils are chained up and the Muslims occupy themselves with fasting, reading Qur’aan, remembering Allaah and all kinds of righteous deeds and good words. Ibn al-‘Arabi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The gates of Paradise are opened to increase hope, so that people will focus on striving to attain it, and to encourage the patient. And the gates of Hell are closed so that sin will decrease and good deeds will take the place of bad deeds and the route to hellfire will be blocked.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>This explains to us why many sinners repent and turn to Allaah, and are keen to worship and obey Him and attend the mosques in this blessed month.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Ramadaan has come, and with it the caller who says: “O seeker of good, go ahead; O seeker of evil, desist.” So answer this call, O Muslim, and hasten to do good deeds.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Ramadaan is one of the special occasions in life. Blessed is the one who makes the most of it, spending its nights in prayer and supplication and its days in fasting, reading Qur’aan, giving charity, upholding the ties of kinship, seeking knowledge and doing righteous deeds.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Our righteous forbears, the companions of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and those who followed them in truth paid a great deal of attention to Ramadaan and rejoiced at its coming. They would pray to Allaah to cause them to live to see the next Ramadaan, then they would ask Him to accept it (their fasting and worship) from them.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>They used to fast its days, protecting their fast from anything that would invalidate it or detract from it such as idle talk and entertainment, backbiting, malicious gossip and lies. They would fill its nights with qiyaam al-layl and recitation of Qur’aan. They would take care of the poor and needy by giving them charity, treating them kindly, feeding them and giving food to the fasting to break their fast.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>They used to strive in worshipping Allaah and they used to strive in jihad against the enemies of Islam, fighting for the sake of Allaah so that the word of Allaah would be supreme and all religion would be for Allaah.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The great Battle of Badr, in which the Muslims were victorious over their enemies, took place on the 17<sup>th</sup> of Ramadaan.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The Conquest of Makkah took place on the 20<sup>th</sup> of Ramadaan, when the people entered the religion of Allaah in crowds and Makkah became the centre of Islam.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The month of Ramadaan is not a month of laziness and sleep, rather it is the month of jihad, worship and work.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>So we should welcome it with joy and happiness, and celebrate and honour this occasion.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>How can we not do that in the month that Allaah has chosen for the obligation of fasting and has prescribed qiyaam al-layl, in which He revealed the Qur’aan to guide mankind and bring them forth from darkness to light?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>How can we not rejoice in a month in which the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained up, when the rewards for good deeds are multiplied and people are raised in status, and sins are forgiven?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>We should make the most of the opportunity of being alive, healthy and young, and spend our lives worshipping Allaah and obeying Him. <i>“And whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger, he has indeed achieved a great achievement (i.e. he will be saved from the Hell‑fire and will be admitted to Paradise)”[al-Ahzaab 33:71 – interpretation of the meaning]</i>.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>We should make the most of the opportunity of the arrival of this blessed month to renew our covenant with Allaah to repent sincerely at all times from all sins and evil deeds, and to continually obey Allaah all our lives, heeding His commands and avoiding what He has forbidden, so that we may be with the successful on the Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail, except him who brings to Allaah a clean heart. (cf. al-Shu’ara’ 26:88-89).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span>Majmoo’at Rasaa’il Ramadaaniyyah</span></i><span>, by Jaar-Allaah, p. 6&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him</span></p>\n<hr width=\"75%\">\n",
